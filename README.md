### Problem Statement

When tracking stocks in brokerage accounts, or other assets, one may want a place to
keep track of all of their holdings in one place.  One may also wish to see how all
of one's assets and investments are doing, especially in relation to each other.  While most
brokerage accounts will show you realized/unrealized gains/losses, there aren't any that
will also track your other assets not held through that account.  Rather than visiting four, five
or even more websites, one may wish to only view one.  To that end, I have decided to 
put together a web application which will keep track of losses and gains, as well as showing
one where their unrealized gains are at, especially in relation to past gains/losses and across
different asset classes.
